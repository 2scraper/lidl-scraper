"""captcha_solver.py — detection + solving policy. Comments may name a site
for context; no site-specific selector or URL lives here. Per-site markers
are passed in by the caller (see BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS in product_parser.py)
rather than hardcoded, so this module stays reusable across the family.

Policy, matching the family's hard-won rule that "detected != blocking":

  - Detection stays broad — run it on every page, unconditionally.
  - A captcha WIDGET present on a page whose products are already rendered
    guards nothing and is not solved: `--solve-captcha when-blocked` (the
    default) only pays for a solve when `count_product_links(html) == 0`.
  - A missing key or a solver-side error is a WARNING, never a crash — the
    run continues, and only reports EXIT_BLOCKED if the page really was
    gated (see output_writer.EXIT_BLOCKED).

No JavaScript crosses this module's boundary: it hands back a plain
(captcha_type, sitekey, token) triple. The engine — which already speaks
its own driver's dialect (Playwright/Selenium/pyppeteer) — is the one that
calls page.evaluate / execute_script to inject the token, because that is
exactly the kind of per-engine primitive `page_flow.py`-style code should
own instead of a shared module quietly picking one driver's dialect.
