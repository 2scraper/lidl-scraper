"""output_writer.py — the row model, JSON/CSV writer, dedupe, exit codes,
and run metadata. Carries (almost) no site knowledge: everything here is
part of the family's shared output CONTRACT — diverging from it needs a
written reason, not a per-site tweak. Ported near-verbatim from
skyscanner-scraper's output_writer.py (CLAUDE.md §7: porting starts by
copying the family-shared modules from the newest sibling and diffing what
changed on purpose) — in turn ported from stockx-scraper's original
(commit 00b5570). The exit codes, STATUS_BY_EXIT map, and finish_run()
outcome-precedence logic are IDENTICAL to both prior family members on
purpose, including the fix from a 2026-09-15 audit that found `blocked` /
`remote_api_error` were being silently ignored whenever products were
present or --allow-empty was passed. Only the `Product` dataclass's
site-specific tail (below the family-common fields) differs per repo.

    """Family-common fields first (same order in JSON and CSV across every
    2scraper repo — stockx-scraper, skyscanner-scraper, and this one);
    lidl.com-specific (grocery item) fields at the end.

    Unlike Skyscanner's itineraries, a Lidl catalog item genuinely has a
    stable identity: `sku` is the site's own product id / EAN when
    `lidl_parser.py` can extract one, falling back to a deterministic
    fingerprint of `product_url` (see `make_sku()`) only when it can't —
    never a random or run-scoped id, so `diff_runs.py` still sees the same
    `sku` for the same item across two different runs.

    `brand` carries the actual product brand printed on the item (a Lidl
    private label like "Simply Nature"/"Preferred Selection", or a
    national brand Lidl also stocks) — a real, meaningful field here,
    unlike skyscanner-scraper's repurposing of it for "operating airline".
    `category` is the grocery aisle/category Lidl itself assigns the item
    (e.g. "Dairy & Eggs", "Bakery"), read from the page's own breadcrumb
    or category-page context, not invented by this scraper.

    `price` / `currency` / `price_source` are the columns diff_runs.py and
    every cross-site tool key off, same as every other family member.
    `price_source` is `"embedded_json"` when the price came from the
    page's own hydration state (this app's framework's embedded state
    blob — see `lidl_parser.py`'s module docstring for what that actually
    is, once confirmed live) and `"dom"` when read off the rendered
    product/result card directly.

    US grocery pricing is commonly store/region-scoped (a zip code or
    selected store changes what a page shows) — `store_id`/`zip_code`
    record which one this row's price actually reflects, so two runs
    against different regions are never silently conflated by
    `diff_runs.py` as "the same item, price changed".
